# Wï»¿hat is it

Sï»¿loofy's Overhauled UI Portraits (otherwise known as SOUP) is a Team Fortress 2 mod that remade much of the outdated in-game renders with fresh reinterpretations. It also worked on Valve servers.

Iï»¿t was a project that I worked on during the tailend of highschool and over the pandemic. At the moment, the project is dormant with no plans to update it.

Iï»¿n the end, the mod replaced the following assets, including any seasonal variations:

* Lï»¿oading screen art
* Mï»¿ain menu characters
* Mï»¿ain menu backgrounds
* Cï»¿lass selection character art
* Pï»¿asstime UI character assets
* Tï»¿utorial splash art
* Dï»¿isabled 3D UI character art

Yï»¿ou can still find it hosted on Gamebanana.
